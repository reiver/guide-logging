# Package "log" ([Logging Guide](../../README.md))

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

Put your **logger** code into the `go-log` repository you previously created.

The name of your package will be `log`. I.e.,:—
```go
package log
```

➤ You might have noticed that the repository is called `go-log`, but the package is named `log`. That is on purpose. The convention in the Go community is to name things this way.

## Check-List

* [ ] Is the name of your **logger** package `log`?
